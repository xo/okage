# Backlog

This document holds the work that is known and not done, with where each item
came from. When an item is done, delete it, and record anything that was
decided in [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md).

Work on the port goes in units: one upstream file with its tests. Claim a unit
under "Units in progress" before you start, with the name of your session.
When the change is committed, delete the claim.

## Units in progress

None.

## Phase 3

### Make the f64 functions of crmath faster

From D26. `crmath.Acos64` and `crmath.Cos64` compute with `math/big` at 160
bits, about 9 microseconds for each call. Compute them in double-double
precision first, and use `math/big` only when that result is too close to
the middle of two `float64` values. Only the clipping of a cubic calls them.

## Phase 4

### Make the pipeline faster

From D18, D28, D33 and D35. okage has no speed target (D35), and this work
stays open. After D33, okage is about 1.2 to 3 times slower than the scalar
code of upstream, and about 4 to 11 times slower than its AVX2 code, on the
benchmarks of D18. Measure and try, in this order, keeping the bytes of every
test:

1. The forms of D17 that are not measured: one loop with a `switch` on the
   stage, and the color channels in local variables. The call of each stage
   through a function value is now a large part of a fill.
2. Lane functions that are just over the budget of the inliner, the calls of
   `blendFn` through a function value, and bounds checks in the stages
   (`go build -gcflags='-m -d=ssa/check_bce'`).
3. A copy of the stages that keeps its values in `archsimd` registers through
   a run of stages, written by a tool, for the SIMD build (D17, D28).
4. The stages of sRGB and `Powf`, which D33 did not change, because no
   benchmark covers them.

### Measure the cost of GOEXPERIMENT=simd in each release of Go

From D18 and D28. In Go 1.27.3 the plain functions are slower in a build with
`GOEXPERIMENT=simd`. Measure it again with each release of Go, as the steps
of "A new release of Go" in `docs/SIMD.md` say, and turn the SIMD paths of
`internal/wide/internal/widegen` on or off again from the measurements.
Also measure whether `GODEBUG=simd` changes what `archsimd` runs, or what
`archsimd.X86` reports (D15, D17).

## Phase 6

### Port the example select of simplecss

From phase 6. `examples/select.rs` of simplecss matches selectors against a
tree of roxmltree. It was not ported while `internal/roxmltree` was being
written. Port it as an example of `internal/simplecss`, with its output.

## Phase 10

### Follow the font model of read-fonts 0.46 more closely

From phase 10, resvg commit `04291b74`, and D9 rule 3. usvg now reads fonts
through the owned font model of read-fonts 0.46, which skrifa 0.49 exports.
`svg/usvg_text_cache.go` and `resolveFont` follow its rules on go-text. Three
differences stay:

1. read-fonts keeps a metric with its MVAR delta as an F48Dot16. Go keeps it
   as a float32, so a rounded metric can differ at a location with a delta.
2. The walk of the paint graph of COLRv1 in `svg/usvg_text_colr_paint.go`
   ports skrifa 0.44 (D32). usvg now walks the graph with the model of read-fonts
   0.46. No test shows a difference.
3. read-fonts reads the strikes of the table EBDT. usvg draws none of its
   glyphs, so Go leaves the strikes out. The result is the same.
